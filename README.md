# FizzBuzz
### The objectives of this project:
1. Install Apache Kafka.
2. Create a topic and write numbers from 1 to 1 million in Kafka.
3. Write a Java application that reads numbers from Kafka and uses the FizzBuzz algorithm.
4. Optimize FizzBuzz.
```
If number % 3 == 0 then fizz.
If number % 5 == 0 then buzz. 
If number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0 then fizz buzz.
All others numbers are output to the console or a file or any other storage.
```
